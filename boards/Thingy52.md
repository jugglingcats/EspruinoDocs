![Nordic Thingy:52](Thingy52/board.jpg)

The Nordic Thingy:52Â® is a compact, power-optimized, multi-sensor development kit. It is an easy-to-use development platform, designed to help you build IoT prototypes and demos, without the need to build hardware or write firmware.


Features
--------

* 6x6 cm plastic and rubber case
* Environment Sensors (temp, humidity, pressure, air quality color and light)
* 9-axis motion sensing (accelerometer, gyroscope and compass)
* Speaker for playing pre-stored samples or tones
* Microphone
* Configurable RGB LED and button.
* Long battery life with Li-ion battery and charging via USB.


<a name="buy"></a>Buying
------

Nordic has [a list of distributors](http://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Buy-Online?search_token=nRF6936)
on their website.

Getting Started
----------------

**Note:** Nordic Thingy devices **do not have Espruino
pre-installed**. As of writing, you will need a Nordic
[nRF52 DK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Bluetooth-low-energy/nRF52-DK)
and a [2x5 pin 0.05" ribbon cable](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1675) to program
your device.

* Pull off the Thingy:52 case
* Attach the ribbon cable to the Thingy and to the `Debug Out` port on the nRF52 DK
* Plug the nRF52 DK in and turn the Thingy:52 on
* Go to http://www.espruino.com/binaries (or http://www.espruino.com/binaries/travis/master/
  for the absolute latest builds) and download the latest file named `espruino_*_thingy52.hex`
* Save it to the `JLINK` drive that should have appeared on your computer and wait for the LEDs on the nRF52 DK to stop flashing
* The red LED on the Thingy should flash to show Espruino has started. If it doesn't,
power the Thingy off and back on.

And you're ready to go! Follow the [Puck.js Getting Started Guide](/Puck.js+Quick+Start) for details
on getting the IDE connected wirelessly.


On-board peripherals
--------------------

On-board peripherals are exposed via the `Thingy` library:

```
// Button
BTN

// R/G/B leds
LED1/2/3  

// MOSFET outputs
MOS1/2/3/4

// External IO outputs
IOEXT0/1/2/3

// Get repeated callbacks with {x,y,z}. Call with no argument to disable
Thingy.onAcceleration = function(callback) { ... }

// Get one callback with a new acceleration value
Thingy.getAcceleration = function(callback) { ... }

// Get repeated callbacks with {pressure,temperature}. Call with no argument to disable
Thingy.onPressure = function(callback) { ... }

// Get one callback with a new {pressure,temperature} value
Thingy.getPressure = function(callback) { ... }

// Get repeated callbacks with {humidity,temperature}. Call with no argument to disable
Thingy.onHumidity = function(callback) { ... }

// Get one callback with a new {humidity,temperature} value
Thingy.getHumidity = function(callback) { ... }

// Get repeated callbacks with air quality `{eC02,TVOC}`. Call with no argument to disable
Thingy.onGas = function(callback) { ... }

//Get one callback with a new air quality value `{eC02,TVOC}`. This may not be useful as the sensor takes a while to warm up and produce useful values
Thingy.getGas = function(callback) { ... }

// Get repeated callbacks with color `{r,g,b,c}`. Call with no argument to disable
Thingy.onColor = function(callback) { ... }

// Get one callback with a new color value `{r,g,b,c}`
Thingy.getColor = function(callback) { ... }

// Play a sound, supply a string/uint8array/arraybuffer, samples per second, and a callback to use when done
Thingy.sound = function(waveform, pitch, callback) { ... }
```

You can also enable the graphical editor blocks for Thingy:52 in the Web IDE
by clicking `Settings` -> `General` ->  `Graphical Editor Extensions`-> `Nordic Thingy:52`


Tutorials
--------

First, it's best to check out the [Puck.js Getting Started Guide](/Puck.js+Quick+Start)

Most tutorials that use Puck.js also apply to the Thingy:52:

Information
-----------

* [nRF52832 Datasheet](/datasheets/nRF52832_PS_v1.0.pdf)
* [Nordic Thingy:52 information](https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Nordic-Thingy-52)


Serial Console
---------------

When power is first applied, the Thingy checks if pin `D3` is at 3.3v (which will be the
case if it is connected to a Serial port's transmit line). If it is, it initialises
the on-chip UART on `D3` (Thingy RX) and `D2` (Thingy TX) and puts the Espruino
console (REPL) on it at 9600 baud.

To use it, connect to a 3.3v output USB to TTL converter as follows:

| Thingy   | USB->TTL converter |
|----------|--------------------|
| GND      | GND                |
| D2       | RX ( -> PC )       |
| D3       | TX ( <- PC )       |
| 3V       | 3.3v (Optional - to run without a battery) |

You can now use the normal Espruino Web IDE, or a serial terminal application at 9600 baud.

When you connect via Bluetooth, the console will automatically move over. To
stop this, execute `Serial1.setConsole(true)` to force the console to stay on
`Serial1`.

**Note:** Serial1 is not enabled by default because it requires the high speed
oscillator to stay on, which increases power draw a huge amount. If you connect
the UART but don't power down and power on the Thingy, you won't get a serial port.


Firmware Updates
-----------------

As of writing, the Thingy:52 bootloader is signed with a private key, so
you need to write firmware using an nRF52 DK board. See the `Getting Started`
guide above.
